# Jq Play Offline (WASM)

[Jq Play Offline](https://jiehong.gitlab.io/jq_offline/) is a web assembly
version of [jqplay](https://jqplay.org/), allowing you to _run_ the full featured
jq in your browser, without sending anything to any backend.

## Key features

- Reliable: this is the full fledge jq, not a re-implementation;
- Safe: no json leaves your browser, nobody knows what you do with it;
- Fast: not network round trip means faster results, and web assembly makes things _fast_;
- Offline: once you've opened the site once, you no longer need an internet connection.

Give it a try!
